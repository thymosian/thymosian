# Hey, I'm Oluwafisayo

I’m figuring out how to make machines smarter, more useful, and better aligned with the real world—especially in spaces like agriculture, robotics, and environmental systems.

Right now, I’m learning fast, building slow (but right), and getting my hands dirty with machine learning, robotics, and control systems. I have a background in Agricultural & Environmental Engineering, but my interests have outgrown the label.

This space is my open lab.

## 🧠 What I’m Into

- Machine Learning that actually works outside of perfect datasets
- Robotics that move through the physical world with real constraints
- Systems that combine software, hardware, sensors, and a bit of logic
- Agriculture as a testbed for intelligence—because it’s messy, vital, and ignored
- Clean design: in code, in thinking, in systems

## 🚧 What You’ll Find Here (Eventually)

This GitHub isn’t polished yet. But it's active. And honest. You’ll start seeing:

- **Mini-projects**: From ML experiments to robotics control sketches  
- **Prototypes**: Small tools that solve real problems or test big ideas  
- **Code journals**: What I tried, what broke, what surprised me  
- **No filler**: No cloned tutorials, no empty commits. Everything is either a question or an answer.

## 🛠️ What I Use (and Break Regularly)

Python · PyTorch · TensorFlow · ROS · OpenCV  
Arduino · MATLAB · Linux · Git · C/C++  
Soldering irons · LaTeX · Zotero · Coffee · Curiosity

## 🧭 Why I’m Doing This

I care about building systems that matter—not just "cool tech."  
Systems that improve how we grow food, interact with machines, and use intelligence in real life.

I’m not in this for flash. I’m here to contribute to the long game.

## 🤝 Let’s Talk

If you're working on anything that touches:
- Machine learning, robotics, or intelligent systems
- Early-stage research, experimentation, or deployment
- Real-world applications (doesn’t have to be AgTech)

…I'd love to connect. I’m open to contributing, learning, collaborating, or being thrown at hard problems.

## 🌱 The Real Goal

Make sense of systems. Make tools that help.  
Keep growing—with code, with science, with purpose.

This is the beginning. Watch this space.
